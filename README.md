# COVID-19 Data Exploration

This project involves an in-depth exploration of COVID-19 data, utilizing various SQL techniques and functions to derive meaningful insights. The dataset contains information about COVID-19 cases, deaths, vaccinations, and population statistics for different locations worldwide.

The initial queries filter the data, focusing on continents and locations with relevant information. It explores metrics such as total cases, total deaths, death percentages, and infection rates per population, shedding light on the impact of COVID-19 on different regions. Additionally, the project breaks down the analysis by continent, revealing insights into global trends.

To enhance data analysis and visualization, the project includes calculations involving COVID-19 vaccinations. 

The project wraps up by creating a view to store data for future visualizations and analyses. This README provides an overview of the SQL queries and techniques used to explore the COVID-19 dataset, offering valuable insights for data analysts and researchers examining the pandemic's impact.
